Given a set of  intervals, find the size of its largest possible subset of intervals such that no three intervals in the subset share a common point.

Input Format

The first line contains an integer, , denoting the number of intervals in the list.
Each line  of the  subsequent lines contains two space-separated integers describing the respective starting () and ending () boundaries of an interval.
Constraints

Output Format

print an integer denoting the size of the largest possible subset of intervals in the given set such that no three points in the subset overlap.

Sample Input

3
1 2
2 3
2 4
Sample Output

2

Explanation

For set , all three intervals fall on point  so we can only choose any  of the intervals. Thus, we print  on a new line.
