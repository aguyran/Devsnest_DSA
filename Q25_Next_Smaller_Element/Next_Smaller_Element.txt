Given an array, print the Next Smaller Element (NSE) for every element. The NSE for an element x is the first smaller element on the right side of x in array. Elements for which no smaller element exist (on right side), consider NSE as -1. 
Examples: 
a) For any array, rightmost element always has NSE as -1. 
b) For an array which is sorted in increasing order, all elements have NSE as -1. 
c) For the input array [4, 8, 5, 2, 25}, the NSE for each element are as follows.

Element         NSE
   4      -->    2
   8      -->    5
   5      -->    2
   2      -->   -1
   25     -->   -1

d) For the input array [13, 7, 6, 12}, the next smaller elements for each element are as follows.  

   Element        NSE
   13      -->    7
   7       -->    6
   6       -->   -1
   12      -->   -1

Constraints:
1 ≤ N ≤ 1000
1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 1000
