Given an array and a number k where k is smaller than the size of the array, we need to find the k’th smallest element in the given array. It is given that all array elements are distinct.

Examples:  
Input: arr[] = {7, 10, 4, 3, 20, 15} 
k = 3 
Output: 7



Input: arr[] = {7, 10, 4, 3, 20, 15} 
k = 4 
Output: 10 

1 ≤ N ≤ 10000000
1 ≤ K ≤ N
0 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 10000000
