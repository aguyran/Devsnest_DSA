Given string num representing a non-negative integer num, and an integer k, return the smallest possible integer after removing k digits from num.

 

Example 1:

Input:
3
1432219
Output: 1219
Explanation: Remove the three digits 4, 3, and 2 to form the new number 1219 which is the smallest.
Example 2:

Example 3:

2
10
Output: "0"
Explanation: Remove all the digits from the number and it is left with nothing which is 0.
 

Constraints:

1 <= k <= num.length <= 100000
num consists of only digits.
num does not have any leading zeros except for the zero itself.
