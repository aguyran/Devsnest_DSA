Given an array of size N containing only 0s, 1s, and 2s; sort the array in ascending order.
You must solve this problem without using the library's sort function.

### Example 1:
```
Input: 
    N = 5
    arr[]= {0 2 1 2 0}
Output:
    0 0 1 2 2
```
##### Explanation:
0s 1s and 2s are segregated into ascending order.

### Example 2:
```
Input: 
    N = 3
    arr[] = {0 1 0}
Output:
    0 0 1
```
##### Explanation:
0s 1s and 2s are segregated into ascending order.

Expected Time Complexity: O(N) <br />
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

<br />

#### Constraints:
```
1 <= N <= 1000000
0 <= A[i] <= 2
```
