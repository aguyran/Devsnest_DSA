Given an array of size N containing only 0s, 1s, and 2s; sort the array in ascending order.


You must solve this problem without using the library's sort function.


N = 5
arr[]= {0 2 1 2 0}
Output:
0 0 1 2 2
Explanation:
0s 1s and 2s are segregated 
into ascending order.
Input: 
N = 3
arr[] = {0 1 0}
Output:
0 0 1
Explanation:
0s 1s and 2s are segregated 
into ascending order.

Expected Time Complexity: O(N)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)


Constraints:
1 <= N <= 1000000
0 <= A[i] <= 2
